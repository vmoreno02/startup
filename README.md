# startup
BYU CS 260 startup application

I now have experience in the terminal and VSCode when it comes to Github.

// startup spec assignment

My startup will be a small wiki, akin to wikis on fandom.com, but limited to Studio Ghibli movies. Different movies will have different pages. Users can log in, mark pages as favorites, and interact with other users in the comment sections on pages. Pages will contain photos from the movies and links to other pages (at minimum, which movie on the wiki was released before/after the current movie). Extra features that I may implement if I have time are quizzes and a random page selector.

Home page:

// aws ec2 assignment

Server's IP address: 18.218.36.221	

SSH command: ssh -i ~/keypair/260keypair.pem ubuntu@18.218.36.221		

I have stopped the server for now. When I begin working on it regularly, I will assign it an elastic IP address.

// simon html assignment

I have learned a lot about HTML by making my own version of the Simon HTML.

- I realized that the <p> tag will add an extra blank line at the end, so if you don't want the line break, you have to do <div><span>.

- <hr /> == line break, <br /> = \n\n

- SVG isn't as scary as it seems.

- <a href=link> == link to page

- <tr> == table row, <td> == table cell

- The Live Server Extension will save my life in this class.
