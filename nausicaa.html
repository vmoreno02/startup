                <i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i> (風の谷のナウシカ, <i>Kaze no Tani no Naushika</i>) is an animated post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Isao Takahata produced the film for publisher Tokuma Shoten and advertising agency Hakuhodo, with TopCraft animating. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is based on Miyazaki's manga of the same name, first serialized on Animage magazine 
                on February 4, 1982 and completed in March 1994. The story itself was inspired by the 
                1971 comic <i>Rowlf</i> by American cartoonist Richard Corben, while the name Nausicaä 
                was derived from the <i>Odyssey</i>. Miyazaki was also strongly inspired by French comic 
                artist Jean Giraud's <i>Arzach</i> (1975). The movie has environmentalist undertones and 
                was presented by the World Wide Fund for Nature when it was released in 1984.
            </p>
            <p>
                While created before Studio Ghibli was founded, the film is often considered to be the beginning of the studio because of the involvement of Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki, Hideaki Anno and Joe Hisaishi. It is often included as part of the Studio's works, including the Studio Ghibli Collection DVDs and Blu-Rays.
            </p>
            <p>
                The movie won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1984.

            <h3 class="text-left">Plot</h3>
            <p>
                One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war which 
                destroyed human civilization and most of the Earth's original ecosystem. Scattered human 
                settlements survive, isolated from one another by the Sea of Decay. The Sea is a jungle 
                of giant plants and fungi swarming with giant insects, which seem to come together only 
                to wage war. Everything in the Sea of Decay, including the air, is lethally toxic. 
                Lord Yupa, sword master and explorer, has spent a year traveling to see if there are any 
                cities left, but every village he visited has been consumed by the toxic jungles or 
                destroyed through war and fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nausicaä is the agile and cheerful young princess of the peaceful Valley of the Wind. 
                Although a skillful fighter, she is humane and peace-loving. She has an unusual gift for 
                communicating with the giant insects (particularly with the Ohmu, the gigantic, armored, 
                caterpillar-like insects who are the most intelligent creatures in the Sea of Decay). 
                She is also noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, and other beings. Inspired by 
                Yupa, a wandering samurai type possessed of great wisdom, Nausicaä frequently explores 
                the Sea of Decay and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true 
                nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated 
                by her skill at "windriding": flying with an advanced glider-like craft with a jet 
                assist called a möwe. Yupa is searching for the mythological man in blue who, according 
                to the legend, will appear surrounded by a sea of gold and reunite the people and nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                One evening, an airship travels through the Valley. Noticing that it's off course, 
                Nausicaä tries to guide the ship. Unfortunately, the ship is attacked by insects. 
                Despite her warnings, the ship crashes onto the cliffs near the Valley of the Wind. 
                Nausicaä tries to rescue a handcuffed girl of her age from the burning wreck, but she 
                dies after revealing that she is Princess Lastelle from the kingdom Pejite and that 
                the cargo of the airship must be destroyed. The airship is from Tolmekia and the cargo 
                is a God Warrior, one of the lethal, giant, biological weapons used in the ancient war. 
                The cargo also contains an insect that calls for help, so Nausicaä calms it down and 
                helps it fly home. She sees that an Ohmu had heard its calls but returns to the jungle.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is later revealed that the God Warrior embryo was unearthed by Pejite, but it was 
                stolen by the more powerful state of Tolmekia. The next day, the Tolmekians, under the 
                leadership of Princess Kushana, invade the Valley to kill the king and secure and revive 
                the Warrior. Kushana explains that the God Warrior will be used to burn the Sea of 
                Decay, although Obaba, an old and blind Valley woman, warns that attempting so will only 
                enrage the Ohmu and lead to more deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kushana attempts to return to Tolmekia with Nausicaä and several others as hostages. 
                Before their departure, Nausicaä reveals to Yupa a hidden garden of jungle plants that 
                are not toxic because they are growing in sand and water from a deep well. Nausicaä 
                explains that the jungle is only toxic due to the toxic soil that covers the surface of 
                the earth. The airships with Kushana and Nausicaä are attacked by a Pejitan gunship, and 
                several of the ships are forced to make an emergency landing in the Sea of Decay. There, 
                Nausicaä communicates with several Ohmu and discovers that the pilot of the Pejitan 
                gunship is still alive. With the help of her glider, Nausicaä rescues the pilot from a 
                swarm of enraged insects. However, they crash and end up in a strange, non-toxic world 
                that is below the Sea of Decay; the plants in the Sea of Decay purify the polluted soil, 
                and in this way produce clean water and sand, which remains hidden in this underground 
                world. The pilot turns out to be Asbel of Pejite, the twin brother of Princess Lastelle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nausicaä and Asbel return to Pejite, which was destroyed after the Pejite people lured 
                the insects from the Sea of Decay into their town in order to kill the occupying 
                Tolmekian forces. The Pejite people reveal that they will do the same thing to the 
                Valley of the Wind in order to recapture the God Warrior. To prevent Nausicaä from 
                alerting the Tolmekians, they capture her, but she escapes with the help of Asbel, his 
                mother, and many others. A Tolmekian ship attacks, and when they attack the airship, 
                Asbel tells Nausicaä to leave and get back to the Valley. She manages to escape and 
                lure the Tomeikians away. Meito and Yupa arrive and shoot down the airship. With a 
                gunship, she returns to the Valley, but along the way they encounter an enormous herd of 
                enraged Ohmu. The herd is heading toward an injured baby Ohmu that is being used by the 
                Pejite people to lure the Ohmu to the Valley. Nausicaä releases the baby Ohmu and gains 
                its trust, and she orders the Pejite soldiers to take her and the baby to where the herd 
                is heading.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tolmekians try stopping the herd with armored vehicles they brought but to no 
                effect. Later, Kushana arrives with the God Warrior to stop the Ohmu herd, but the 
                Warrior, woken too early, dies in the process. However, Nausicaä, with the baby Ohmu, is 
                finally able to stop the Ohmu herd, but she is overrun and slain in the process. In 
                front of the Valley people and the Tolmekian forces, the Ohmu use their gold-colored 
                tentacles to revive Nausicaä, whose dress has turned blue with the baby Ohmu's blood; 
                thus Nausicaä becomes mythological "man" in blue mentioned in the beginning. The film 
                ends with fragments of a future where people and insects live in peace with each other.

        <!--<div class="wiki-text">
            <h3 class="text-left">Characters</h3>
            <h4>Chihiro Ogino/Sen (荻野 千尋, Ogino Chihiro)</h4>
            <p>
                Chihiro is the 10-year old protagonist of the movie. She is in the process of moving 
                to a new town when her family stumbles upon the entrance to the spirit world. During 
                her adventure she matures from a whiny, self-centered, and pessimistic child to a 
                hard-working, responsible, optimistic young girl who has learned to care for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is renamed "Sen" (千, sen, lit. "a thousand") by the proprietor of the bathhouse, 
                Yubaba. In Japanese orthography, "Sen" is an alternative pronunciation of "Chi", the 
                first kanji in her name "Chihiro", which roughly translates as "a thousand fathoms". 
                The movie ends with Chihiro retaining her new inner strength. It is implied that someday, 
                she will meet Haku again. 
            </p>
            <h4>Haku/Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi (ハク/ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Haku/Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "white dragon")</h4>
            <p>
                A young boy who helps Chihiro after her parents have transformed into pigs. He protects 
                her from danger and gives her advice. Haku works as Yubaba's direct subordinate, often 
                running errands and performing missions for her. He can fly and his true form is a dragon. 
                Toward the end of the story, Chihiro recalls falling into the Kohaku river, of which Haku 
                is the spirit; she thus frees him from Yubaba's service by helping him remember his real 
                name and past, which he had forgotten due to the name change and the curse which Yubaba 
                had placed on him.
            </p>
            <p>
                While he seems often cold-hearted and is disliked by the bathhouse staff, Haku is 
                unfailingly kind to Chihiro, perhaps because of his experience of her in the past, which 
                he partly remembers. When Yubaba is listening, Haku is as sharp-voiced to Chihiro as to 
                anyone else so as to avoid the revelation of his fondness for her. Yubaba sees him 
                merely as a tool. At the end of the movie, he promises to see Chihiro again, presumably 
                after he breaks his apprenticeship.
            </p>
            <h4>Yubaba (湯婆婆, Yubaaba, lit. "bath crone")</h4>
            <p>
                An old witch with an inhumanly large head and nose who supervises the bathhouse. She 
                reluctantly signs Chihiro into a contract (having, at some point in the past, bound 
                herself with an oath to give a job to anybody who asks). Yubaba then takes Chihiro's 
                name and renames her "Sen" in order to hold power over her for the duration of the 
                contract. Yubaba has an over-bearing and authoritarian personality, but she does show a 
                soft side toward her giant baby, Boh.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to her simple and hospitable sister Zeniba, Yubaba lives in opulent quarters 
                and is only interested in taking care of guests for money. Though she is very intuitive 
                and perceptive, she does not notice when her own baby is gone. When Haku prompts her by 
                telling her that something she values is missing, her first reaction is to scrutinize 
                her gold. She is the main antagonist.
            </p>
            <h4>Kamajī (釜爺/缶爺, lit. "kettle geezer"/"boiler geezer")</h4>
            <p>
                An old man with six arms who operates the boiler room of the bathhouse. A number of 
                Susuwatari, or soot balls, work for him by carrying coal into his furnace. He has a 
                large cabinet where he keeps all the herbs that are used in the baths. After some 
                persuasion, he allows Chihiro to work at the bathhouse and even pretends to be her 
                grandfather to protect her, though this ruse does not stand for long. He later takes 
                an injured Haku into his boiler room and cares for him while Chihiro, given train 
                tickets by Kamajī, journeys to Zeniba's cottage. At first he seems cold and uncaring, 
                but by the end of the movie, he seems to have grown a soft spot for Chihiro and for 
                anyone whom she calls her friend. His appearance resembles a large humanoid spider, 
                with several arms which seem to be stretchable.
            </p>
            <h4>No-Face (カオナシ, Kaonashi, lit. "without face")</h4>
            <p>
                No-Face is an odd spirit who takes an interest in Chihiro. Chihiro, seeing No-Face 
                standing outside in the rain, takes pity on him and lets him into the bathhouse to 
                take shelter from the storm. At first, he is a strange, cloaked, masked wraith that 
                merely breathes and smiles. No-Face is a lonely being who seems to sustain himself on 
                the emotions of those he encounters, particularly their emotional reception to his 
                gifts. He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the 
                bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold, 
                he reacts to their greed by becoming a hideous monster. He later throws up, calms down, 
                and reverts to his former state after he leaves the bathhouse's influence. At the end, 
                he stays with Zeniba as a helper.
            </p>
            <h4>Lin (リン, Rin)</h4>
            <p>
                A worker at the bathhouse who becomes Chihiro's caretaker. Although aloof at first, 
                she warms up to and bonds with Chihiro. When Chihiro leaves the bathhouse, Lin warns 
                No-Face, who had previously gone on a rampage, not to harm Chihiro. In the end, she is 
                happy for Chihiro when the latter finally goes home. In the English dub, Lin states that 
                she wishes to leave the bathouse for some better life, but realizes that she wants to 
                go back to her parents. She is very surprised when Kamajī gives Chihiro train tickets 
                and does not understand Sen and Haku's love.

            <h4>Boh (坊, Bō)</h4>
            <p>
                Boh is Yubaba's son. Although he has the appearance of a young sumo baby, he is twice 
                Yubaba's size. He is also very strong and can be dangerous. Yubaba spoils him and goes 
                out of her way to give him whatever he wants. He believes that going outside will make 
                him ill. When Sen is trapped in his room, she tells Boh that staying in his room all the 
                time will sicken him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, Zeniba turns him into a mouse. He becomes good friends with Chihiro while in his 
                mouse form and eventually stands up to Yubaba to protect Chihiro. Boh tells Yubaba he 
                had a good time when he was with Chihiro. His little adventure may be seen as an analogy 
                to Chihiro's adventures and growing up. This idea suggests that Boh is overgrown sumo 
                because he has never really matured under Yubaba's doting care.
            </p>
            <h4>Zeniba (銭婆, Zeniba, zeni can refer to both money and public baths, making her name a play on Yubaba's)</h4>
            <p>
                Zeniba is Yubaba's twin sister and rival. Although identical in appearance, their 
                personalities are almost polar opposites. At first, she appears no kinder than Yubaba 
                when she becomes enraged at Haku for stealing her magic seal and threatens to take it 
                back, regardless of what happens to Haku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hoping to gain Zeniba's forgiveness, Chihiro journeys to Zeniba's cottage to return it 
                and apologize. It is then that Zeniba reveals her true character as that of a kind, 
                grandmotherly figure, even sentimentally requesting Chihiro to call her "Granny" in the 
                English version. She forgives Haku for stealing her seal (in the Japanese version she 
                states that she no longer blames him) and tells him to look after Chihiro. She then sees 
                everyone off, assuring Chihiro that she will be well. Zeniba additionally takes No-Face 
                as an assistant.
