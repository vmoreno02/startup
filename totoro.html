                <i>Spirited Away</i> (千と千尋の神隠し, <i>Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi</i>, literally 
                translated as <i>"Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"</i>), is the 12th animated film 
                written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story is about the adventures of a young ten-year-old girl named Chihiro as she 
                wanders into the world of the gods and spirits. She is forced to work at a bathhouse 
                following her parents being turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film was made to please the ten-year-old daughter of Hayao Miyazaki's personal 
                friend, director Seiji Okuda. Okuda's daughter even became the model for the film's 
                protagonist, Chihiro. During the film's planning phase, Miyazaki gathered the daughters 
                of Ghibli's staff in a mountain hut in Shinano Province to hold a training seminar. 
                His experience led him to wanting to make a film for them, since he had never made a 
                movie for girls at the age of 10.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film earned a massive ¥31,680 billion in Japan, a record only beaten by 
                <i>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train</i> in 2020. It received 
                multiple international awards, including the Golden Bear Award at the 52nd Berlin 
                International Film Festival and the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, 
                the first anime film to win an Academy Award, and the only winner of that award to win 
                among five nominees. Due to his efforts in promoting the film in North America, John 
                Lasseter, one of the founding fathers of Pixar, became the executive producer of the 
                English dub.

            <h3 class="text-left">Plot</h3>
            <p>
                Chihiro Ogino, a disaffected child, is annoyed about having to move to a new town. 
                She is traveling with her parents to their new home. While driving, Chihiro's father 
                attempts to take a shortcut; they subsequently lose their way and come across a 
                mysterious red gate and a tunnel. The tunnel exits to a clock tower and leads to what 
                appears to be an abandoned theme park, lined with seemingly empty restaurants. Finding 
                a restaurant fully stocked with unattended food, both parents eat the food they find 
                and, as a result, transform into pigs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chihiro's distress at losing her parents is compounded by the discoveries that the world 
                around her has changed with nightfall and that her body is disappearing. A mysterious 
                boy named Haku appears, comforts Chihiro, and gives her a red berry to eat, which makes 
                her solid again. He smuggles her into a large bathhouse owned and operated by the witch 
                Yubaba, where thousands of spirits come to refresh themselves. Haku tells Chihiro that 
                the only way she can remain in the spirit-world long enough to rescue her parents is by 
                gaining employment in Yubaba's bathhouse. When Chihiro asks Haku how he seems to know 
                her so well, Haku replies that he has known Chihiro since she was very small.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, she tries to get work with Kamajī, who works at the boiler room, but is 
                rejected. Kamajī instead hands Chihiro off to a worker named Lin to take her to Yubaba. 
                In Yubaba's penthouse suite, Chihiro repeatedly asks for a job. Yubaba ultimately consents, 
                on condition that Chihiro give up her name. 
                Yubaba literally takes possession of Chihiro's real name, leaving Chihiro with one part 
                of one character of her original two-character name, in isolation pronounced "Sen". 
                Taking a person's name gives Yubaba power to keep its owner in her service permanently; 
                it is revealed that Haku is also in Yubaba's service, and remains so because she has taken 
                part of his full name.
            </p>
            <p>
                While at work, Sen gives admittance to a wraithlike spirit called No-Face, who returns 
                the favor by helping her obtain herbal water needed to bathe a stink spirit whom no one 
                else will help. After bathing, the stink spirit is revealed to be a powerful River Spirit 
                who rewards Sen with a strong emetic dumpling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subsequently, Sen sees Haku in the form of a white dragon, and later on helps save him 
                from paper birds that are attacking him. Searching for the injured Haku, Sen encounters 
                Yubaba's massive infant son, Boh, at her apartment. Sen finds Haku, who was attacked by 
                Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister, because Haku had stolen her sigil. When Boh distracts 
                Zeniba, she transforms Boh into a mouse and Yubaba's pet crow into a hummingbird. Zeniba 
                tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic gold seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries 
                a deadly curse. Haku then rips up the remaining paper bird, causing Zeniba to disappear. 
                After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of 
                the river spirit's dumpling. The dumpling causes Haku to spit out the stolen sigil, 
                which he had swallowed. He also chokes up a black slug which Sen squishes, though Haku 
                remains unconscious. Hoping to lift Zeniba's curse and save Haku from a coma, Sen 
                decides to set out to return the sigil to Zeniba.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, No-Face has become intoxicated with the greedy atmosphere of the bathhouse 
                and swells into a huge monster, giving illusory gold to the bathhouse workers in exchange 
                for food. When the workers do not comply with his demands, he eats several of them, 
                causing a panic and throwing the entire bathhouse into pandemonium. Sen manages to solve 
                the problem by feeding No-Face the remaining dumpling, making him regurgitate several 
                million tons of black poison and the bathhouse workers, then leads him out of the 
                bathhouse. No-Face reverts to his former size and demure personality, and along with Sen, 
                Boh, and the hummingbird, takes the sea railway to Zeniba's faraway cottage at Swamp Bottom. At 
                Zeniba's home, Sen gives the sigil back to Zeniba, apologizing for having squished the 
                black slug. An amused Zeniba reveals that the slug had been one of Yubaba's means of 
                controlling Haku and that the curse put on the seal has already been broken by Sen's 
                friendship.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the bathhouse, Yubaba discovers Boh's absence and is enraged. Haku, now revived and 
                restored to his human form, offers Boh's safe return in exchange for Sen and her parents 
                to be freed and restored to normal. Yubaba accepts, but promises to set Sen one final 
                task. Along with Boh and the hummingbird, Haku and Sen fly back to the bathhouse, leaving 
                No-Face to live with Zeniba as her assistant. En route to the bathhouse, Chihiro remembers 
                a previous meeting with Haku: some time ago, she had fallen into a river and was rescued 
                by the river's spirit. She then realizes that the spirit of this river, called Kohaku River, 
                and her friend Haku are one and the same, and thus revealing Haku's real name, Nigihayami 
                Kohakunushi, which literally translates to "God of the Swift Amber River." At this 
                realization, Haku's dragon form molts away, and he is completely freed from Yubaba's 
                control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yubaba and a large crowd have gathered to witness Chihiro's final task: picking out her 
                cursed parents from a group of pigs. Chihiro correctly states that none of the pigs 
                displayed by Yubaba are her parents and thus wins back both her parents' humanity and 
                her own freedom. Afterward, Haku takes Chihiro to rejoin her restored parents. He bids 
                her farewell and promises that he will come see her again. As Chihiro and her parents 
                return to their world, her parents lose all memory of their visit to the spirit world. 
                The family then gets back in their car and resume their journey to their new home. 
                Miyazaki himself has stated that Chihiro also forgets her adventure in the spirit world, 
                but it is hard to tell in the dub version whether or not she did because of extra lines 
                of dialogue added at the end. These extra lines are from Chihiro's dad and herself; her 
                dad worries about her having to live somewhere else and go to a different school, but 
                Chihiro replies that she thinks she can handle it. In the sub version, she silently 
                thinks about her adventure.

        <!--characters-->
        <div class="wiki-text">
            <h3 class="text-left">Characters</h3>
            <h4>Chihiro Ogino/Sen (荻野 千尋, Ogino Chihiro)</h4>
            <p>
                Chihiro is the 10-year old protagonist of the movie. She is in the process of moving 
                to a new town when her family stumbles upon the entrance to the spirit world. During 
                her adventure she matures from a whiny, self-centered, and pessimistic child to a 
                hard-working, responsible, optimistic young girl who has learned to care for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is renamed "Sen" (千, sen, lit. "a thousand") by the proprietor of the bathhouse, 
                Yubaba. In Japanese orthography, "Sen" is an alternative pronunciation of "Chi", the 
                first kanji in her name "Chihiro", which roughly translates as "a thousand fathoms". 
                The movie ends with Chihiro retaining her new inner strength. It is implied that someday, 
                she will meet Haku again. 
            </p>
            <h4>Haku/Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi (ハク/ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Haku/Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "white dragon")</h4>
            <p>
                A young boy who helps Chihiro after her parents have transformed into pigs. He protects 
                her from danger and gives her advice. Haku works as Yubaba's direct subordinate, often 
                running errands and performing missions for her. He can fly and his true form is a dragon. 
                Toward the end of the story, Chihiro recalls falling into the Kohaku river, of which Haku 
                is the spirit; she thus frees him from Yubaba's service by helping him remember his real 
                name and past, which he had forgotten due to the name change and the curse which Yubaba 
                had placed on him.
            </p>
            <p>
                While he seems often cold-hearted and is disliked by the bathhouse staff, Haku is 
                unfailingly kind to Chihiro, perhaps because of his experience of her in the past, which 
                he partly remembers. When Yubaba is listening, Haku is as sharp-voiced to Chihiro as to 
                anyone else so as to avoid the revelation of his fondness for her. Yubaba sees him 
                merely as a tool. At the end of the movie, he promises to see Chihiro again, presumably 
                after he breaks his apprenticeship.
            </p>
            <h4>Yubaba (湯婆婆, Yubaaba, lit. "bath crone")</h4>
            <p>
                An old witch with an inhumanly large head and nose who supervises the bathhouse. She 
                reluctantly signs Chihiro into a contract (having, at some point in the past, bound 
                herself with an oath to give a job to anybody who asks). Yubaba then takes Chihiro's 
                name and renames her "Sen" in order to hold power over her for the duration of the 
                contract. Yubaba has an over-bearing and authoritarian personality, but she does show a 
                soft side toward her giant baby, Boh.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to her simple and hospitable sister Zeniba, Yubaba lives in opulent quarters 
                and is only interested in taking care of guests for money. Though she is very intuitive 
                and perceptive, she does not notice when her own baby is gone. When Haku prompts her by 
                telling her that something she values is missing, her first reaction is to scrutinize 
                her gold. She is the main antagonist.
            </p>
            <h4>Kamajī (釜爺/缶爺, lit. "kettle geezer"/"boiler geezer")</h4>
            <p>
                An old man with six arms who operates the boiler room of the bathhouse. A number of 
                Susuwatari, or soot balls, work for him by carrying coal into his furnace. He has a 
                large cabinet where he keeps all the herbs that are used in the baths. After some 
                persuasion, he allows Chihiro to work at the bathhouse and even pretends to be her 
                grandfather to protect her, though this ruse does not stand for long. He later takes 
                an injured Haku into his boiler room and cares for him while Chihiro, given train 
                tickets by Kamajī, journeys to Zeniba's cottage. At first he seems cold and uncaring, 
                but by the end of the movie, he seems to have grown a soft spot for Chihiro and for 
                anyone whom she calls her friend. His appearance resembles a large humanoid spider, 
                with several arms which seem to be stretchable.
            </p>
            <h4>No-Face (カオナシ, Kaonashi, lit. "without face")</h4>
            <p>
                No-Face is an odd spirit who takes an interest in Chihiro. Chihiro, seeing No-Face 
                standing outside in the rain, takes pity on him and lets him into the bathhouse to 
                take shelter from the storm. At first, he is a strange, cloaked, masked wraith that 
                merely breathes and smiles. No-Face is a lonely being who seems to sustain himself on 
                the emotions of those he encounters, particularly their emotional reception to his 
                gifts. He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the 
                bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold, 
                he reacts to their greed by becoming a hideous monster. He later throws up, calms down, 
                and reverts to his former state after he leaves the bathhouse's influence. At the end, 
                he stays with Zeniba as a helper.

            <h4>Lin (リン, Rin)</h4>
            <p>
                A worker at the bathhouse who becomes Chihiro's caretaker. Although aloof at first, 
                she warms up to and bonds with Chihiro. When Chihiro leaves the bathhouse, Lin warns 
                No-Face, who had previously gone on a rampage, not to harm Chihiro. In the end, she is 
                happy for Chihiro when the latter finally goes home. In the English dub, Lin states that 
                she wishes to leave the bathouse for some better life, but realizes that she wants to 
                go back to her parents. She is very surprised when Kamajī gives Chihiro train tickets 
                and does not understand Sen and Haku's love.
            </p>
            <h4>Boh (坊, Bō)</h4>
            <p>
                Boh is Yubaba's son. Although he has the appearance of a young sumo baby, he is twice 
                Yubaba's size. He is also very strong and can be dangerous. Yubaba spoils him and goes 
                out of her way to give him whatever he wants. He believes that going outside will make 
                him ill. When Sen is trapped in his room, she tells Boh that staying in his room all the 
                time will sicken him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, Zeniba turns him into a mouse. He becomes good friends with Chihiro while in his 
                mouse form and eventually stands up to Yubaba to protect Chihiro. Boh tells Yubaba he 
                had a good time when he was with Chihiro. His little adventure may be seen as an analogy 
                to Chihiro's adventures and growing up. This idea suggests that Boh is overgrown sumo 
                because he has never really matured under Yubaba's doting care.
            </p>
            <h4>Zeniba (銭婆, Zeniba, zeni can refer to both money and public baths, making her name a play on Yubaba's)</h4>
            <p>
                Zeniba is Yubaba's twin sister and rival. Although identical in appearance, their 
                personalities are almost polar opposites. At first, she appears no kinder than Yubaba 
                when she becomes enraged at Haku for stealing her magic seal and threatens to take it 
                back, regardless of what happens to Haku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hoping to gain Zeniba's forgiveness, Chihiro journeys to Zeniba's cottage to return it 
                and apologize. It is then that Zeniba reveals her true character as that of a kind, 
                grandmotherly figure, even sentimentally requesting Chihiro to call her "Granny" in the 
                English version. She forgives Haku for stealing her seal (in the Japanese version she 
                states that she no longer blames him) and tells him to look after Chihiro. She then sees 
                everyone off, assuring Chihiro that she will be well. Zeniba additionally takes No-Face 
                as an assistant.
