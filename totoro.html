            <h3 class="text-left">Plot</h3>
            <p>
                In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and 
                Mei, move into an old house in the country to be closer to the hospital where their 
                mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. Satsuki and Mei find that the 
                house is inhabited by Sootballs - small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving 
                from light to dark places. While the girls can see them, their father can't, however, an 
                elderly neighbor (whom the girls can call Granny) tells them she used to see Sootballs 
                when she was their age. Soon, they all get to work cleaning the house and unpacking. 
                Later on, Granny's grandson, Kanta, visits with a basket but acts shy around Satsuki. 
                When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their father, the 
                Sootballs leave the house to drift away on the wind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The family goes to the hospital to visit their mom who is improving. The doctors say 
                that she should be able to come home in two weeks. The next day, Satsuki starts class 
                at her new school. While Tatsuo grades papers at home, Mei goes off exploring. Soon, she 
                sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass and follows the ears under the house. She 
                discovers two small magical creatures who lead her through a briar patch and into the 
                hollow of a large camphor tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same 
                kind of spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as 
                Totoro. She falls asleep atop the large Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on 
                the ground in a dense briar clearing. Despite her many attempts, Mei is unable to show 
                her family Totoro's tree. Her father comforts her by telling her that this is the spirit 
                of the forest and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. When they find the 
                tree, the hole is gone. While Satsuki is disappointed, she is assured that she will see 
                him if she's lucky.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, Satsuki leaves Mei with Kanta's parents and Granny for the day. However, during 
                the school day, Granny brings Mei to Satsuki's school. Mei refused to stop crying until 
                she saw Satsuki, who tells Mei she has to stay with Granny since their father is teaching 
                and she has school. Mei insists on staying, so with the teacher's permission, she sits 
                next to Satsuki and colors, to Satsuki's chagrin. At the end of the school day, it starts 
                to rain. The girls wait in a temple near the path until the rain lightens up. Kanta walks 
                by and gives the girls his umbrella and runs home. At home, Satsuki works on her homework 
                and Mei does some art. When their father is scheduled to return from work, the girls 
                head to the bus stop to meet him, but he is not on the bus so they decide to wait, and 
                it grows dark. As they wait, Mei eventually falls asleep on Satsuki's back.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Totoro appears beside them. He only has a leaf on his head for protection against the 
                rain, so Satsuki offers him her extra umbrella. Totoro is delighted at both the shelter 
                and the sounds that raindrops make on the umbrella. He likes it so much he jumps and 
                makes all the drops fall on the umbrella and lets out a roar which wakes Mei and the 
                rain stops. Soon another bus comes, but it's a bus-shaped giant cat (known as the Catbus). 
                In gratitude, he gives the girls a bundle of nuts and seeds. Totoro boards the bus, 
                taking the umbrella. Shortly after, their father's bus arrives and he explains the train 
                was crowded so he had to wait for the for the next bus. The girls excitedly tell him 
                what they saw, and then they head home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Satuski writes to their mom and tells her everything that happened. The girls plant the 
                seeds, but they aren't growing and Mei watches them every day. A few days later, the 
                girls sleep outside in the heat and are awakened at midnight to find Totoro and his two 
                miniature colleagues engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. The girls 
                join in, and the seeds sprout, grow, and combine into an enormous tree. Totoro takes his 
                colleagues and the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. Afterwards, they sit in the 
                tree and play a flute Totoro gives them. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds 
                have indeed sprouted, which means they weren't dreaming after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some time later, the girls help Granny harvest some vegetables and Mei wants to give her 
                mom the corn she picked. The girls find out from a telegram that their mother's hospital 
                wants them to call the doctor. Kanta takes Satuski to his uncle's house to use the phone, 
                and Mei follows them despite being told to stay with Granny. Satuski contacts her father 
                and says he'll call the number and get back to her. As it turns out, a planned visit by 
                Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Satsuki, disappointed 
                and worried, tells Mei the bad news, which Mei does not take well. This leads into an 
                argument between the two, ending in Satsuki angrily yelling at Mei and stomping off. 
                Mei starts to cry and Kanta walks with her. Back at the house, the girls both sit alone. 
                Satuski worries that her mother may die. After seeing her sister upset, Mei decides to 
                walk to the hospital to bring some fresh corn to her mother.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. It starts to 
                grow dark before she is found. Eventually, Satsuki returns in desperation to the camphor 
                tree and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons the Catbus, 
                which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. Having rescued her, the Catbus then whisks 
                her and Satsuki over the countryside to see their mother in the hospital. The girls 
                perch in a tree outside of the hospital, overhearing a conversation between their parents 
                and discovering that she has been kept in hospital by a cold and is otherwise doing well. 
                Their mother still can't believe the doctor would send a telegram over something this 
                minor. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered 
                by the parents, and return home on the Catbus. When the Catbus departs, it disappears 
                from the girls' sight. Granny is happy that Mei is safe and Kanta apologizes for how he 
                acted.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end credits, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, with Totoro and his friends as unseen observers.

        <!--<div class="wiki-text">
            <h3 class="text-left">Characters</h3>
            <h4>Chihiro Ogino/Sen (荻野 千尋, Ogino Chihiro)</h4>
            <p>
                Chihiro is the 10-year old protagonist of the movie. She is in the process of moving 
                to a new town when her family stumbles upon the entrance to the spirit world. During 
                her adventure she matures from a whiny, self-centered, and pessimistic child to a 
                hard-working, responsible, optimistic young girl who has learned to care for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is renamed "Sen" (千, sen, lit. "a thousand") by the proprietor of the bathhouse, 
                Yubaba. In Japanese orthography, "Sen" is an alternative pronunciation of "Chi", the 
                first kanji in her name "Chihiro", which roughly translates as "a thousand fathoms". 
                The movie ends with Chihiro retaining her new inner strength. It is implied that someday, 
                she will meet Haku again. 
            </p>
            <h4>Haku/Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi (ハク/ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Haku/Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "white dragon")</h4>
            <p>
                A young boy who helps Chihiro after her parents have transformed into pigs. He protects 
                her from danger and gives her advice. Haku works as Yubaba's direct subordinate, often 
                running errands and performing missions for her. He can fly and his true form is a dragon. 
                Toward the end of the story, Chihiro recalls falling into the Kohaku river, of which Haku 
                is the spirit; she thus frees him from Yubaba's service by helping him remember his real 
                name and past, which he had forgotten due to the name change and the curse which Yubaba 
                had placed on him.
            </p>
            <p>
                While he seems often cold-hearted and is disliked by the bathhouse staff, Haku is 
                unfailingly kind to Chihiro, perhaps because of his experience of her in the past, which 
                he partly remembers. When Yubaba is listening, Haku is as sharp-voiced to Chihiro as to 
                anyone else so as to avoid the revelation of his fondness for her. Yubaba sees him 
                merely as a tool. At the end of the movie, he promises to see Chihiro again, presumably 
                after he breaks his apprenticeship.
            </p>
            <h4>Yubaba (湯婆婆, Yubaaba, lit. "bath crone")</h4>
            <p>
                An old witch with an inhumanly large head and nose who supervises the bathhouse. She 
                reluctantly signs Chihiro into a contract (having, at some point in the past, bound 
                herself with an oath to give a job to anybody who asks). Yubaba then takes Chihiro's 
                name and renames her "Sen" in order to hold power over her for the duration of the 
                contract. Yubaba has an over-bearing and authoritarian personality, but she does show a 
                soft side toward her giant baby, Boh.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to her simple and hospitable sister Zeniba, Yubaba lives in opulent quarters 
                and is only interested in taking care of guests for money. Though she is very intuitive 
                and perceptive, she does not notice when her own baby is gone. When Haku prompts her by 
                telling her that something she values is missing, her first reaction is to scrutinize 
                her gold. She is the main antagonist.
            </p>
            <h4>Kamajī (釜爺/缶爺, lit. "kettle geezer"/"boiler geezer")</h4>
            <p>
                An old man with six arms who operates the boiler room of the bathhouse. A number of 
                Susuwatari, or soot balls, work for him by carrying coal into his furnace. He has a 
                large cabinet where he keeps all the herbs that are used in the baths. After some 
                persuasion, he allows Chihiro to work at the bathhouse and even pretends to be her 
                grandfather to protect her, though this ruse does not stand for long. He later takes 
                an injured Haku into his boiler room and cares for him while Chihiro, given train 
                tickets by Kamajī, journeys to Zeniba's cottage. At first he seems cold and uncaring, 
                but by the end of the movie, he seems to have grown a soft spot for Chihiro and for 
                anyone whom she calls her friend. His appearance resembles a large humanoid spider, 
                with several arms which seem to be stretchable.
            </p>
            <h4>No-Face (カオナシ, Kaonashi, lit. "without face")</h4>
            <p>
                No-Face is an odd spirit who takes an interest in Chihiro. Chihiro, seeing No-Face 
                standing outside in the rain, takes pity on him and lets him into the bathhouse to 
                take shelter from the storm. At first, he is a strange, cloaked, masked wraith that 
                merely breathes and smiles. No-Face is a lonely being who seems to sustain himself on 
                the emotions of those he encounters, particularly their emotional reception to his 
                gifts. He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the 
                bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold, 
                he reacts to their greed by becoming a hideous monster. He later throws up, calms down, 
                and reverts to his former state after he leaves the bathhouse's influence. At the end, 
                he stays with Zeniba as a helper.
            </p>
            <h4>Lin (リン, Rin)</h4>
            <p>
                A worker at the bathhouse who becomes Chihiro's caretaker. Although aloof at first, 
                she warms up to and bonds with Chihiro. When Chihiro leaves the bathhouse, Lin warns 
                No-Face, who had previously gone on a rampage, not to harm Chihiro. In the end, she is 
                happy for Chihiro when the latter finally goes home. In the English dub, Lin states that 
                she wishes to leave the bathouse for some better life, but realizes that she wants to 
                go back to her parents. She is very surprised when Kamajī gives Chihiro train tickets 
                and does not understand Sen and Haku's love.

            <h4>Boh (坊, Bō)</h4>
            <p>
                Boh is Yubaba's son. Although he has the appearance of a young sumo baby, he is twice 
                Yubaba's size. He is also very strong and can be dangerous. Yubaba spoils him and goes 
                out of her way to give him whatever he wants. He believes that going outside will make 
                him ill. When Sen is trapped in his room, she tells Boh that staying in his room all the 
                time will sicken him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, Zeniba turns him into a mouse. He becomes good friends with Chihiro while in his 
                mouse form and eventually stands up to Yubaba to protect Chihiro. Boh tells Yubaba he 
                had a good time when he was with Chihiro. His little adventure may be seen as an analogy 
                to Chihiro's adventures and growing up. This idea suggests that Boh is overgrown sumo 
                because he has never really matured under Yubaba's doting care.
            </p>
            <h4>Zeniba (銭婆, Zeniba, zeni can refer to both money and public baths, making her name a play on Yubaba's)</h4>
            <p>
                Zeniba is Yubaba's twin sister and rival. Although identical in appearance, their 
                personalities are almost polar opposites. At first, she appears no kinder than Yubaba 
                when she becomes enraged at Haku for stealing her magic seal and threatens to take it 
                back, regardless of what happens to Haku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hoping to gain Zeniba's forgiveness, Chihiro journeys to Zeniba's cottage to return it 
                and apologize. It is then that Zeniba reveals her true character as that of a kind, 
                grandmotherly figure, even sentimentally requesting Chihiro to call her "Granny" in the 
                English version. She forgives Haku for stealing her seal (in the Japanese version she 
                states that she no longer blames him) and tells him to look after Chihiro. She then sees 
                everyone off, assuring Chihiro that she will be well. Zeniba additionally takes No-Face 
                as an assistant.
