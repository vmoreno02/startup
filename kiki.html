                <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i> (魔女の宅急便, <i>Majo no Takkyūbin</i>, literally 
                <i>"Witch's Delivery Service"</i>), is a 1989 animated fantasy film written, directed and produced by Hayao Miyazaki. It was animated by Studio Ghibli for publisher Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport Co. and the Nippon Television Network and distributed by the Toei Company.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film is based on the children's novel of the same name by Eiko Kadono. However, the film deviated from the original novel's story and themes, which upset Kadono during its production. She has since reconciled with Miyazaki.[1] A more faithful live action film adaptation was released on March 1, 2014, featuring Kadono as the narrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film began production on April 1, 1988, and was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, and won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize. It was the first film released under a 15-year distribution partnership between The Walt Disney Company and Studio Ghibli; Buena Vista Home Video recorded an English dub in 1997, which premiered in United States theaters at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998. The film was released on home video in the U.S. and Canada on September 15, 1998.

            <h3 class="text-left">Plot</h3>
            <p>
                One blustery day, thirteen-year-old witch-in-training Kiki lies idle on a field 
                listening to her dad's radio when she hears an announcement that the evening would 
                be clear with a beautiful full moon. She rushes home and informs her mother, Kokiri, that she plans to leave home that very evening instead 
                of the following month as she had originally planned. As Kiki rushes to her room to 
                pack, Kokiri informs her client of the age-old tradition of 13-year-old witches 
                leaving home for a year on the night of a full moon to pursue their skill through 
                training. As Kiki packs her belongings upstairs, her companion, a talking black cat named Jiji, 
                asks why they can't wait till next month as they planned. Kiki tells him that if she 
                meets a boy or something else occurs, she might not leave at all. Her father, Okino, 
                arrives home and learns of Kiki's plans to depart that night, which cancels their 
                camping trip that weekend. He begins calling relatives to inform them Kiki is leaving 
                and soon, Kokiri fits Kiki with her purple witch's uniform.
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening, her family and friends gather to send Kiki off. Kokiri gives Kiki her 
                broom, though at first Kiki is reluctant to take it. Her mother assures her this broom 
                guided her to this town and it will guide Kiki. She leaves home with Jiji as her 
                parents and family wishes her well. Along the way, she encounters a fortune-telling 
                witch who tells her of the challenges she may face when settling in a new town. They 
                part ways as she has completed her one year of training and is returning to her home 
                town. Eventually it starts to rain, and soon Kiki and Jiji land in a train's box car 
                where they spend the night.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The next morning, the rain clears up, so Kiki flies on her 
                broomstick to the port city of Koriko. The citizens, however, seem unfazed by her arrival. 
                A police officer questions her reckless flying, but he gets distracted, giving Kiki a 
                chance to leave. While trying to find somewhere to live, Kiki is pursued by Tombo 
                Kopoli, a geeky boy obsessed with aviation who admires her flying ability. Kiki refuses 
                to talk to a stranger, although she thanks Tombo for getting her out of trouble. After 
                a day of searching for lodging, Kiki soon finds herself at a bakery owned by Osono, the 
                kindly and heavily pregnant owner, who seems completely overwhelmed by the number of 
                customers. After helping Osono return a pacifier to a baby, the two have a talk and 
                Osono learns that Kiki currently had nowhere to stay. She offers Kiki a small apartment 
                over their storage area to stay in and Kiki gratefully accepts.
            </p>
            <p>In exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono mind the store. She confesses that her 
                only skill is flying, so they decide to open a "Witch Delivery Business", delivering 
                goods by broomstick. Kiki works hard at the store and soon they get the place all 
                fixed up. One of Osono's regular customers named Maki notices Kiki and asks her to 
                deliver a birthday gift for her nephew, Ket. Kiki gladly accepts and before leaving, 
                she is spotted ascending into the air by Tombo, who wishes he could fly like her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, her first delivery goes badly as she is caught by a strong gust of wind 
                and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver. Since Jiji looks so similar to 
                the toy cat, Kiki has him pretend to be the toy until she can find the real one. While 
                at the young boy's house, Jiji is under the watchful eye of the family dog, Jeff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Kiki finds the toy cat in the cabin of a young painter, Ursula. Noticing that 
                the toy is ripped, Ursula offers to mend it in exchange for Kiki cleaning her floor. 
                Once it is fixed, Ursula returns the doll and Kiki hurries off to save Jiji. They are 
                able to make the switch easily with the help of Jeff and return home.
            </p>
            <p>
                As customers for her delivery service slows to a trickle Kiki falls into a slump. She 
                reluctantly accepts a party invitation from Tombo and his friends from the Aviation 
                Club. She arrives at the home of her next delivery appointment, an elderly woman who 
                had been trying to make a herring and pumpkin potpie for her granddaughter's birthday. 
                When the electric oven doesn't work, Kiki offers the woman help with her wood-burning 
                oven in order to make the pie. 
                The woman remembers that her clock runs a few minutes slow which, and Kiki 
                realizes she will be late for Tombo's party. The Potpie is ready so Kiki rushes off 
                to deliver it. On route, it begins to rain heavily as she delivers the potpie for the 
                woman's granddaughter. When she arrives to the young girl's house, Kiki is stunned when 
                she expresses her loathing of the potpie but accepts the gift reluctantly. Kiki makes 
                her way home in silence through the rain. Exhausted from the journey, soaking wet from 
                the rain, and having missed the party, Kiki soon falls ill with a fever.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she recovers, Osono clandestinely arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning 
                her a delivery addressed to him. After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo 
                shows off the new dirigible that arrived in town for repairs. He takes her for a test 
                ride on the flying machine he built from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to Tombo but is 
                intimidated by his petty friends, who seem to look down at her. Upset, she walks home 
                in defeat, despite Tombo trying to be kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kiki's slump is worsened when discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has 
                befriended a pretty white cat living next door. Kiki realizes that she is also losing 
                her flying ability and witch powers, and she is forced to suspend her delivery business 
                until she gets back her flying powers. She also tells Tombo over the phone she won't 
                see him anymore out of sadness. Osono becomes worried about her. Kiki has a surprise 
                visit from Ursula at the bakery, who after hearing what happened determines that Kiki's 
                crisis is a form of artist's block and offers her time away at her cabin in order to 
                relax. There, Kiki sees that Ursula was working on her latest painting, 
                inspired by her encounter with Kiki. Later that night, Ursula talks about how she had 
                gone through a similar situation, but with her art rather than powers. Ursula solved her 
                problem by realizing that she had to find her own art style, rather than copying others. 
                She suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose in life, she will regain her powers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following morning, Kiki visits the old woman. She personally wanted to thank Kiki 
                for her hard work when she was last at the house and presents a cake she had in 
                gratitude. At the same time, the television reports that the dirigible "The Spirit of 
                Freedom" is set to depart. As the "Seahorse Band" and crowd bid the airship farewell, a 
                sudden gale dislodges the airship's moors and it is blown off course, with Tombo hanging 
                from the rope under the airship. The airship manages to crash into the clock tower and 
                is suspended above the town plaza. Kiki then witnesses the Tombo hanging from one of the 
                drifting vessel's mooring lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kiki takes a street sweeper's push-broom and, miraculously regaining her flying power, 
                flies towards Tombo, who remains in danger even as the airship settles between two 
                buildings. Kiki flies as fast as she can and, after some initial struggling with keeping 
                the broom in place, manages to rescue Tombo as he slips and falls. During the 
                celebration, Kiki rejoins with Jiji who hops on her shoulder and is once again speaking. 
                She regains her confidence and resumes her delivery service. She also joins the aviation 
                club. Osono gives birth to a healthy baby and Jiji becomes the father of four kittens. 
                The story ends when Kiki writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy and 
                doing well with her witch skills.

        <!--<div class="wiki-text">
            <h3 class="text-left">Characters</h3>
            <h4>Chihiro Ogino/Sen (荻野 千尋, Ogino Chihiro)</h4>
            <p>
                Chihiro is the 10-year old protagonist of the movie. She is in the process of moving 
                to a new town when her family stumbles upon the entrance to the spirit world. During 
                her adventure she matures from a whiny, self-centered, and pessimistic child to a 
                hard-working, responsible, optimistic young girl who has learned to care for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is renamed "Sen" (千, sen, lit. "a thousand") by the proprietor of the bathhouse, 
                Yubaba. In Japanese orthography, "Sen" is an alternative pronunciation of "Chi", the 
                first kanji in her name "Chihiro", which roughly translates as "a thousand fathoms". 
                The movie ends with Chihiro retaining her new inner strength. It is implied that someday, 
                she will meet Haku again. 
            </p>
            <h4>Haku/Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi (ハク/ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Haku/Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "white dragon")</h4>
            <p>
                A young boy who helps Chihiro after her parents have transformed into pigs. He protects 
                her from danger and gives her advice. Haku works as Yubaba's direct subordinate, often 
                running errands and performing missions for her. He can fly and his true form is a dragon. 
                Toward the end of the story, Chihiro recalls falling into the Kohaku river, of which Haku 
                is the spirit; she thus frees him from Yubaba's service by helping him remember his real 
                name and past, which he had forgotten due to the name change and the curse which Yubaba 
                had placed on him.
            </p>
            <p>
                While he seems often cold-hearted and is disliked by the bathhouse staff, Haku is 
                unfailingly kind to Chihiro, perhaps because of his experience of her in the past, which 
                he partly remembers. When Yubaba is listening, Haku is as sharp-voiced to Chihiro as to 
                anyone else so as to avoid the revelation of his fondness for her. Yubaba sees him 
                merely as a tool. At the end of the movie, he promises to see Chihiro again, presumably 
                after he breaks his apprenticeship.
            </p>
            <h4>Yubaba (湯婆婆, Yubaaba, lit. "bath crone")</h4>
            <p>
                An old witch with an inhumanly large head and nose who supervises the bathhouse. She 
                reluctantly signs Chihiro into a contract (having, at some point in the past, bound 
                herself with an oath to give a job to anybody who asks). Yubaba then takes Chihiro's 
                name and renames her "Sen" in order to hold power over her for the duration of the 
                contract. Yubaba has an over-bearing and authoritarian personality, but she does show a 
                soft side toward her giant baby, Boh.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to her simple and hospitable sister Zeniba, Yubaba lives in opulent quarters 
                and is only interested in taking care of guests for money. Though she is very intuitive 
                and perceptive, she does not notice when her own baby is gone. When Haku prompts her by 
                telling her that something she values is missing, her first reaction is to scrutinize 
                her gold. She is the main antagonist.
            </p>
            <h4>Kamajī (釜爺/缶爺, lit. "kettle geezer"/"boiler geezer")</h4>
            <p>
                An old man with six arms who operates the boiler room of the bathhouse. A number of 
                Susuwatari, or soot balls, work for him by carrying coal into his furnace. He has a 
                large cabinet where he keeps all the herbs that are used in the baths. After some 
                persuasion, he allows Chihiro to work at the bathhouse and even pretends to be her 
                grandfather to protect her, though this ruse does not stand for long. He later takes 
                an injured Haku into his boiler room and cares for him while Chihiro, given train 
                tickets by Kamajī, journeys to Zeniba's cottage. At first he seems cold and uncaring, 
                but by the end of the movie, he seems to have grown a soft spot for Chihiro and for 
                anyone whom she calls her friend. His appearance resembles a large humanoid spider, 
                with several arms which seem to be stretchable.

            <h4>No-Face (カオナシ, Kaonashi, lit. "without face")</h4>
            <p>
                No-Face is an odd spirit who takes an interest in Chihiro. Chihiro, seeing No-Face 
                standing outside in the rain, takes pity on him and lets him into the bathhouse to 
                take shelter from the storm. At first, he is a strange, cloaked, masked wraith that 
                merely breathes and smiles. No-Face is a lonely being who seems to sustain himself on 
                the emotions of those he encounters, particularly their emotional reception to his 
                gifts. He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the 
                bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold, 
                he reacts to their greed by becoming a hideous monster. He later throws up, calms down, 
                and reverts to his former state after he leaves the bathhouse's influence. At the end, 
                he stays with Zeniba as a helper.
            </p>
            <h4>Lin (リン, Rin)</h4>
            <p>
                A worker at the bathhouse who becomes Chihiro's caretaker. Although aloof at first, 
                she warms up to and bonds with Chihiro. When Chihiro leaves the bathhouse, Lin warns 
                No-Face, who had previously gone on a rampage, not to harm Chihiro. In the end, she is 
                happy for Chihiro when the latter finally goes home. In the English dub, Lin states that 
                she wishes to leave the bathouse for some better life, but realizes that she wants to 
                go back to her parents. She is very surprised when Kamajī gives Chihiro train tickets 
                and does not understand Sen and Haku's love.
            </p>
            <h4>Boh (坊, Bō)</h4>
            <p>
                Boh is Yubaba's son. Although he has the appearance of a young sumo baby, he is twice 
                Yubaba's size. He is also very strong and can be dangerous. Yubaba spoils him and goes 
                out of her way to give him whatever he wants. He believes that going outside will make 
                him ill. When Sen is trapped in his room, she tells Boh that staying in his room all the 
                time will sicken him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, Zeniba turns him into a mouse. He becomes good friends with Chihiro while in his 
                mouse form and eventually stands up to Yubaba to protect Chihiro. Boh tells Yubaba he 
                had a good time when he was with Chihiro. His little adventure may be seen as an analogy 
                to Chihiro's adventures and growing up. This idea suggests that Boh is overgrown sumo 
                because he has never really matured under Yubaba's doting care.
            </p>
            <h4>Zeniba (銭婆, Zeniba, zeni can refer to both money and public baths, making her name a play on Yubaba's)</h4>
            <p>
                Zeniba is Yubaba's twin sister and rival. Although identical in appearance, their 
                personalities are almost polar opposites. At first, she appears no kinder than Yubaba 
                when she becomes enraged at Haku for stealing her magic seal and threatens to take it 
                back, regardless of what happens to Haku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hoping to gain Zeniba's forgiveness, Chihiro journeys to Zeniba's cottage to return it 
                and apologize. It is then that Zeniba reveals her true character as that of a kind, 
                grandmotherly figure, even sentimentally requesting Chihiro to call her "Granny" in the 
                English version. She forgives Haku for stealing her seal (in the Japanese version she 
                states that she no longer blames him) and tells him to look after Chihiro. She then sees 
                everyone off, assuring Chihiro that she will be well. Zeniba additionally takes No-Face 
                as an assistant.
