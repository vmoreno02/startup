                <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> (ハウルの動く城, <i>Howl no Ugoku Shiro</i>), is the 14th 
                animated fantasy film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, produced by Toshio Suzuki and animated 
                by Studio Ghibli. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is based on the 1986 novel of the same name (translated in Japan as <i>The Wizard's 
                Howl and the Devil of Fire</i>) by British writer Diana Wynne Jones and is about a 
                young milliner named Sophie, who is transformed into an old woman by a witch, and the 
                wizard Howl.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first half of the film is relatively faithful to the original novel, but the second 
                half was changed completely during development, adding themes of war not present in the 
                source material. The original author, Diana Wynne Jones' only request was that Miyazaki 
                "not change Howl's character". She later gave a positive impression of the film, saying 
                it retained the same spirit as her original work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on 
                September 5, 2004, and was screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival on October 
                23, 2004. It went on to gross ¥23.2 billion worldwide, making it one of the most 
                financially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, 
                particularly for its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated 
                for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 78th Academy Awards, but lost to 
                <i>Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</i>, in 2006, and won several other 
                awards, including four Tokyo Anime Awards and a Nebula Award for Best Script.

            <h3 class="text-left">Plot</h3>
            <p>
                Sophie, a needlewoman who works at her family's hat shop, is a responsible-yet-plain 
                18-year-old girl who goes to Cesari's Café to visit her sister when she encounters a 
                mysterious wizard named Howl. This encounter arouses the evil Witch of the Waste, who 
                later enters the hat shop and transforms Sophie into a 90-year-old woman. As the curse 
                prevents her from telling anyone of her condition, Sophie decides to leave her home of 
                Market Chipping and seek out a cure out in the waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, Sophie meets upon the hill the scarecrow Turnip Head. She passes a 
                mysterious moving castle and enters it. At this point, she meets an enchanted fire 
                demon named Calcifer, who powers the castle and recognizes that Sophie has been cursed. 
                Calcifer offers to break the curse in exchange for Sophie's help in breaking the spell 
                he's under, which keeps Calcifer bound to the house. She also meets Howl's young 
                apprentice, Markl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she is the castle's new 
                cleaning lady, hired by Calcifer because he was sick of how dirty the castle was.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Sophie's home country of Ingary, the beginning of a war has sparked against another 
                neighboring town following the disappearance of the other realm's Crown Prince. Slowly, 
                the war begins to creep into Ingary. Howl receives summons from the King, who orders his 
                various assumed identities to fight in the war. However, Howl cowers in his bedroom and 
                comes up with an idea to send Sophie to pose as his mother, announcing that he would be 
                useless. At the palace in the capital of Kingsbury, Sophie runs into an asthmatic dog, 
                Heen, who she thinks is Howl undercover. She also meets the Witch of the Waste, who 
                rides on a palanquin carried by two blob men. Magical wards disintegrate the Witch's 
                henchmen and she is forced to travel by foot. They begin to race up the stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once they are inside the castle, Heen and Suliman's servant lead Sophie to the 
                greenhouse while the Witch of The Waste finds herself a place to sit down - only to find 
                her magical powers drained by Suliman as a punishment. This causes her to regress into 
                a harmless old woman with few memories of her past actions. Suliman tells Sophie that 
                Howl will meet the same fate if he does not contribute to the war. As Sophie vehemently 
                protests these measures, the Witch's spell temporarily weakens due to the love in her 
                words. This causes Sophie to change briefly to her younger self, then regress to her 
                older persona. Madame Suliman realizes Sophie's true relation to Howl and her romantic 
                feelings towards him. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to entrap Howl 
                by summoning star children and revealing his monstrous form, but with Sophie's help, 
                they escape. Howl suggests drawing their pursuers away as Sophie make her way back to 
                the castle. He offers her a magic ring which would help guide her back safely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophie learns that Howl is able to transform into a bird-like creature to interfere in 
                the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human 
                form. Howl, in an attempt to appease Sophie, transforms a part of the castle's into her 
                old home by the hat shop and even shows her a secret garden he used to stay in his 
                childhood. Sophie fears that Howl is preparing to leave them, as his remaining time as 
                a human is limited, and he returns to interfering in the war. Sophie's mother visits 
                under Suliman's control and leaves behind a bag containing a "peeping bug". The former 
                Witch of the Waste discovers it and promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into 
                Calcifer, who gets sick, rendering him unable to conceal the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few hours later, enemy aircraft carpet-bomb the city while Suliman's blob men invade 
                the hat shop. After arriving just in time to protect the shop from the bombing, Howl 
                draws the guards away after healing Calcifer. He tells Sophie he is not going to run 
                away anymore because he has something he wants to protect before leaving to interfere 
                with the war. Deducing that Howl must be saved, Sophie moves everyone out of the castle 
                and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, destroying the castle. She offers Calcifer some 
                of her braided hair to give him enough strength to power a portion of the castle. They 
                head toward Howl when the former Witch of the Waste discovers Howl's heart within 
                Calcifer. Sophie pours water on Calcifer to make her let go of the heart, making 
                Calcifer lose his power. The segment of the castle splits, and she and Heen fall down 
                a chasm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using her magic ring, Sophie makes her way toward Howl's heart and enters through the 
                door into Howl's childhood. She stumbles into his old cottage and looks upon his old 
                things. Outside the marshlands, she sees dozens of falling stars vanish as they land 
                on the earth. She then sees Howl and Calcifer meet: Howl swallows Calcifer, who gains Howl's 
                heart. Sophie finds Howl, who has now lost his human consciousness in bird form. They 
                head back to the group, and Sophie asks the Witch for Howl's heart. She places the heart 
                back in Howl, resurrecting him and freeing Calcifer. She kisses the scarecrow who 
                reveals that he is actually the missing prince. Heen shows the scene of their happy end 
                to Suliman, and the war is finally over. Howl, Sophie, and the others return home from 
                the end of the war, flying high above the bomber planes in a moving house.

        <!--characters-->
        <div class="wiki-text">
            <h3 class="text-left">Characters</h3>
            <h4>Sophie Hatter (ソフィー・ハッター, Sofī Hattā)</h4>
            <p>
                The protagonist of the movie and the eldest of three sisters (though only two appear 
                in the movie). She is eighteen years old and works as a needlewoman at her family's 
                store, the "Hatter's Hat Shop", which was originally managed by her father.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is transformed into a 90-year-old old woman by the curse of the Witch of the Waste 
                and later becomes Howl's cleaning lady. She develops romantic feelings for Howl.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike her prettier and more popular sister Lettie she appears plain. After turning 
                into an old woman, she slowly gains confidence in herself. She originally possesses 
                brown hair, but after being cursed, her hair becomes "stained by the light of the star" 
                according to Howl. Sophie herself does not notice that her age changes depending on her 
                emotional state.
            </p>
            <h4>Howl (ハウル , Hauru)</h4>
            <p>
                Another protagonist. A pretty young man, Howl was rumored to eat the hearts of beautiful 
                women. He travels throughout the land of Ingary via a magical moving castle. According 
                to Suliman, he was a talented wizard who would've succeeded her in court, but he abruptly 
                left due to his immaturity and cowardly nature. He hid himself and went under various 
                pseudonyms such as Jenkins and Pendragon. He lived a somewhat wretched life away from 
                society, but grew to be more humane thanks to Sophie. Howl came under contract with the 
                fire demon Calcifer in his youth, which further increased his magical powers. However, 
                his constant use of demonic powers proved to be dangerous, and Suliman would later warn 
                him that he may become a demon himself. Howl happens to have a long deceased uncle who 
                left a hidden flower garden on his study in his old cottage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Howl began as a blonde, he fell into a deep depression upon seeing Sophie's 
                cleaning which dissolved some of his magic, turning his hair black. He eventually 
                recovered, and kept his new black hair. Whenever Howl flies to the battlefield, he 
                transforms into a huge black swallow that possesses his human face.
            </p>
            <h4>Witch of the Waste (荒地の魔女, Arechi no Majo)</h4>
            <p>
                A witch who had been exiled from the royal palace to the wastelands after making a contract with a demon fifty years before the events of the film began. She dresses in opulent jewelry and black fur and carries herself much like a wealthy woman. She moves around using a palanquin due to her corpulent figure and aversion to sunlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her singular goal is to take Howl's heart. She is also obsessed with youth and beauty and boasts strong magical powers. She holds a grudge against Suliman who exiled her from the royal palace. Her magical powers are taken away from a power exposure to light, and her true form is revealed to be a senile old woman.
            </p>
            <h4>Calcifer (カルシファー , Karushifā)</h4>
            <p>
                The fire demon who signed a contract with Howl. He received Howl's heart and in return, 
                he gave the young wizard incredible magical powers. He also bound himself to a magical 
                moving castle. Additionally, according to their contract, Calcifer's life is directly 
                linked to Howl's. Calcifer plots with Sophie to find a way to break their pact so he 
                can be free. However, he fears that Howl is abusing his new demonic power and hopes 
                breaking their contract will save him from further corruption.
            </p>
            <h4>Markl (マルクル , Marukuru)</h4>
            <p>
                Howl's disciple. A young boy who appears to be around 8-10 years old. When he leaves the 
                house or deals with customers, he wears a magical cloak that disguises him as a petite 
                old man a long mustache. He refers to Howl with the "san" honorific whenever they 
                converse. When he first meets Sophie, he behaves like an adult, but he gradually shows 
                his childish nature. He hates potatoes and fish.
            </p>
            <h4>Turnip Head (Prince Justin) (カブ , Kabu)</h4>
            <p>
                A scarecrow with turnip as a head . He is saved by Sophie after his head gets caught in a bush in the outskirts of the wastelands, and he later becomes a resident of a moving castle. He cannot speak and gets along by hopping around. Sophie kisses him, revealing his true form to be a beautiful prince of the neighboring country. He explains he was turned into a scarecrow, possibly by Suliman. He promises peace between the two warring kingdoms, and hops away on his magical stick, possibly indicating he is a wizard.
            </p>
            <h4>Suliman (サリマン , Sariman)</h4>
            <p>
                Howl's former master, also known as Madame Suliman. She's an old, silver-haired witch with a wheelchair who heads the kingdom's magic academy and serves the royal family's court. An intelligent and seemingly gentle woman, she possesses far greater magical power than Howl. She's the true power behind the kingdom of Ingary and was never completely in favor of the war. As it becomes clearer towards the finale of the film that their kingdom is being bombed into ruin, she decides to end the war upon contacting her agent, Heen.
            </p>
            <h4>Heen (ヒン , Hin)</h4>
